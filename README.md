Wahb Mohamed

AI Engineer in Training | Computer Science Student | Deep Learning & Computer Vision

Welcome to my GitHub. I’m Wahb Mohamed, a computer science student focused on applied AI, with a strong emphasis on deep learning, computer vision, and generative models. I care less about buzzwords and more about building systems that work, scale, and explain themselves.

My work revolves around understanding models deeply—both mathematically and practically—and then using them to solve real problems.

Current Focus

Deep Learning with a strong emphasis on CNNs, GANs, and multimodal models

Generative Models: GANs, Conditional GANs, CycleGAN, WGAN (theory + implementation)

Computer Vision: image analysis, face-related tasks, deepfake detection

Applied AI Systems: building end-to-end pipelines (model → backend → user-facing app)

Exploring AI for security, media integrity, and education

Technical Skills

Programming Languages

Python (primary)

C, JavaScript

SQL, Prolog

Machine Learning & AI

TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Classical ML, Ensemble Methods, Feature Selection

Deep Learning

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

GANs (DCGAN, WGAN, Conditional GANs, CycleGAN)

Transfer Learning

Multimodal Learning (Audio + Video)

Model explainability & training diagnostics

Tools & Systems

Git & GitHub

Linux (Ubuntu)

FastAPI

Notion

VS Code

Selected Work & Interests

Multimodal Deepfake Detection System
Deep learning system combining video and audio (MFCC-based) analysis with frame-level explanations. Designed to be accessible, explainable, and usable as an API or extension.

AI-Based Technical Interview Preparation Platform
Beginner-focused system using voice-based mock interviews with dynamic AI follow-ups and performance analysis.

Real-Time Analytics & AI Pipelines
Interest in building systems that go beyond notebooks into production-ready architectures.

Learning Philosophy

I don’t rush tools.
I focus on foundations first, then implementation, then optimization.
Understanding why a model works matters more to me than just making it run.

Vision

To build AI systems that are:

Technically solid

Ethically aware

Explainable

And genuinely useful

Long term, I aim to work at the intersection of deep learning research and real-world AI products.
